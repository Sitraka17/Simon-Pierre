# Simon-Pierre
Text Based Adventure Game for the life of Peter

## The idea was to try to make a decision game thanks to Python.


## Text-based Adventure Game

This is a text-based adventure game written in Python. The game is designed to simulate a conversation between the biblical figure of Peter and Jesus. The player is asked to make a choice between doubt or trust, and their decision affects the outcome of the game.

## Getting Started
To run the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## How to Play
Run the game by typing python forler.py in the terminal.
Read the introduction and choose your path by entering either 1 or 2.
Depending on your choice, you will receive a different outcome.
After the outcome is displayed, you will be asked if you want to play again.

## Code Description

The game starts with an introduction that sets the scene for the conversation between Peter and Jesus. The player is then prompted to make a choice between doubt and trust. The choice is validated and passed on to the 'checkPath()' function, which displays a different outcome based on the choice.

The game can be played multiple times by using a while loop that asks the player if they want to play again.

# Credits

This game is based on the code written by Mr. McNally. The code was modified and translated into French by me (Sitraka Forler).
